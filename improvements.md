This document outlines **how I improved the project**, **what changed**, and **why** ‚Äî written clearly for reviewing my hybrid chat submission.

---

## Objective

To build a **robust, hybrid retrieval chatbot** for Vietnam travel using:
- Vector embeddings (for semantic context)
- Graph enrichment (for structural relationships)
- A chat model (for fluent itinerary generation)

---

## Key Enhancements (Summary)

| Area | Before | After (My Implementation) |
|------|---------|----------------------------|
| **Embeddings** | OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` (1536D) | **Google Gemma embeddings (768D)** ‚Äì free, open-source, robust |
| **Vector DB** | Minimal Pinecone upsert | Full vector service with batching, index auto-creation, metadata |
| **Graph DB** | Simple Neo4j load | Detailed schema with `LOCATED_IN`, `HAS_TAG`, `SAME_CITY`, `SIMILAR_TAGS`, `IN_REGION` |
| **Chat** | Single model call | Multi-provider fallback (OpenRouter ‚Üí OpenAI ‚Üí mock) |
| **Structure** | Flat scripts | Clean modular design: `services/`, `scripts/`, `data/` |
| **Docs** | None | Full `README.md` + `improvements.md` with detailed explanations |
| **Error Handling** | Minimal | Defensive imports, clear log messages, mock fallbacks |
| **Testing** | None | `test_connections.py` for sanity checks |

## Embeddings: Gemma instead of OpenAI

Initially, I used **OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small (1536D)`**, but this model is **paid and closed-source**.  
To ensure accessibility and reproducibility, I **switched to Google‚Äôs open-source Gemma embeddings (768D)**.

**Advantages:**
- Free and open-source (no billing dependency)
- Smaller dimension ‚Üí faster indexing, lower Pinecone storage
- Excellent semantic recall for travel context
- Works with offline/OSS environments

The embedding service now automatically detects which provider is available and falls back to Gemma if OpenAI is not configured.

---

## Vector Service Improvements

- Added **index existence checks**, **automatic creation**, and **batch uploads**.
- Embedded **metadata enrichment** (type, city, tags, description).
- Added **error handling & logging** for long uploads.
- Supports fallback deterministic embeddings for local testing.

These changes make the Pinecone upload reliable even with partial connectivity.

## üï∏Ô∏è Graph Enhancements (Neo4j)

- Redesigned node schema:
  - `City`, `Attraction`, `Hotel`, `Activity`, and `Region`
- Relationships:
  - `LOCATED_IN` ‚Äì connects places to cities
  - `HAS_TAG` ‚Äì connects nodes to tag nodes
  - `IN_REGION` ‚Äì connects cities to region nodes
  - `SAME_CITY` ‚Äì connects nodes sharing the same city
  - `SIMILAR_TAGS` ‚Äì connects nodes sharing overlapping tags
- Added **constraints** for unique `id` across labels.
- Added **region + tag node creation** for faster semantic traversal.

**Result:** richer graph context improves grounding in generated responses.

---

## Chat Model Layer (Hybrid LLM Service)

- Supports **OpenRouter**, **OpenAI**, or **mock chat** modes.
- Modularized in `services/chat_service.py`.
- Includes clear system prompt with instructions to:
  - Cite node IDs
  - Use both vector + graph context
  - Generate brief, grounded itineraries
- Added retry logic and graceful degradation if network fails.

**Result:** The chat layer never crashes the pipeline ‚Äî it degrades gracefully with clear user messages.

---

## Testing & CI

- Added `test_connections.py` for quick validation:
  - Embedding generation
  - Pinecone index access
  - Neo4j session check
  - Chat model reachability
- Added GitHub Actions CI workflow to automate basic tests and linting.

---

## Developer Experience Improvements

- All scripts use `sys.path.append()` or `-m` execution to avoid `ModuleNotFoundError`.
- Added progress logs and batch counters.
- Added `.cache/embeddings.json` for local caching.
- Added `.env` configuration for all credentials and tuning parameters.
- Added structured logs (`[INFO]`, `[WARN]`, `[ERR]`) for readability.
